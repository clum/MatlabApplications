This is simply how they chose to model the dynamic pitch dampening effect of the tail.  This is attempting to add behavior which makes it difficult to pitch the vehicle at a high rate.  When q is large this creates a large AoA of the tail which in turn actually creates a negative pitching moment which counteracts the pitch rate.  You could get a similar effect by adding this to the moment equation but for whatever reason, they chose to model it here.  Let me know if you want to chat more about this at office hours.""}"
