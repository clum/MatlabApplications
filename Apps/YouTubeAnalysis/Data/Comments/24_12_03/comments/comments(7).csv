""},{""text"":""\n""},{""text"":""\n""},{""text"":""To answer your question, the nomenclature of 'degrees of freedom' is sometimes a little lose.  With traditional rigid body dynamics, you can describe the orientation (sometimes also referred to as the pose) using 6 values (3 translational position and 3 rotation euler angles).  This is why most people refer to this as a 6 DOF model.  However, if you are generating a dynamic model of this vehicle, from our investigation of state space models, we know that we actually need twice that many number of states (3 translational positions, 3 translational velocities, 3 rotational positions, and 3 rotational velocities) for a total of 12 states.  Confusingly, sometimes people refer to states as degrees of freedom so you really need to be careful of the context in which these terms are used.  In this particular video, you are correct in the sense that I've restricted the motion/dynamics to a 2D plane and as such, there are only 3 DOF which need 6 states to describe.  Does this answer your question?""}"
